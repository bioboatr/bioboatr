I am [faculty at the Dept of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://eeb.ku.edu/people/jamie-walters) at the University of Kansas.

I research Evolutionary Genomics, particularly sex chromosomes and reproductive biology in Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies).

I teach courses that focus on introductory genetics, genome biology, and R programming for biology.
